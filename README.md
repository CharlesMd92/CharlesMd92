## 🧭 About Me
Blockchain developer with a strong **Bitcoin foundation** and a **builder mindset**.  
Formed initially in Python and automation, today I focus on **Solidity, JavaScript, Web3** and the architecture of decentralized systems.

I build on Ethereum and EVM ecosystems using the **principles learned from Bitcoin**:  
**descentralización, verificación, privacidad, incentivos y seguridad**.

Currently completing the **Alchemy Academy** path, including the advanced course  
**Solidity Governance**, and expanding into Web3 full-stack, Chainlink and TON.

## 🚧 Featured Projects (Storytelling Path)

### 🔹 **SolfaCoin (ERC-20)**
My first real step into Web3: an ERC-20 token built with Hardhat.  
I used this project to understand deployment flows, ABI interaction, gas usage, and token economics.

---

### 🔹 **LotteryBros — Smart Contract Lottery**
A lottery contract built in Solidity, designed to explore randomness, fairness and contract structure.  
Future improvements include Chainlink VRF integration and automated tests.

### 🔹 **NFTs – SolfaChuzas (ERC-721)**
NFT collection for my basketball ecosystem experiment.  
Focus on metadata, minting flows, and contract modularity.

---

### 🔹 **Automation Bots (Python)**
**my-sugar-diary** and **casa-helper-bot** showcase my earlier background in scripting, automation and API integration.  
These projects demonstrate versatility beyond EVM smart contracts.

## 🧡 Why Me?
Because I’m a **bitcoiner at the core**, but a **practical builder** in Web3:

- I learn fast and build faster  
- I verify everything  
- I combine Bitcoin principles with EVM execution  
- I use IA to accelerate my development without sacrificing rigor  
- I want to grow inside the blockchain industry and contribute long-term
